## Hi there!
My name is Jakub Duchniewicz and this is my personal space :) \
I am currently finishing my BSc in Computer Science at Warsaw University of Technology, pursuing a thesis in FPGA's and Linux drivers. 
Once it is complete I will publish it here and while I am digging more into it, expect to see some articles related to DMA's, IIR filters and other curios.

## What's in here?
On this website you can find some thoughts of mine on several topics ranging from:
* Microcontrollers and FPGA's 
* Game Engines 
* Machine Learning
* Linux and other OS's topics

Please feel free to reach out to me, or leave a comment, I am always eager to have a chat or give a helping hand!

### Little bit more
I am an active developer of [PolyEngine], and if you would like to join us don't hesitate! 
Currently it undergoes some restructurization and implementation of Editor and Vulkan rendering engine (we used OpenGL based one so far), so if you are specialized in either Qt or Vulkan -- we need you! (We welcome you anyway :heart:)
