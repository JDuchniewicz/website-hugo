{{< polaroid src="/me2_resized.jpg" alt="Jakub waving" caption="Hi! I‚Äôm Jakub üëã" max="280px" >}}

My name is **Jakub Duchniewicz** and this is my personal space :grin:

I am currently working as a programmer at **[Tietoevry]** doing 5G NR L1 development from the Modem UE side on a custom ASIC for an **Unspecified Client**. :grin: I am also a co-founder of **[Sticky Piston Studios]** - a jack-of-all-trades company where **we make any advanced tech tick**!

My skills include low-level programming in **C**, **C++** and **Rust**. Being proficient in hardware accelerators, such as **FPGA**s I happen to know some **Verilog** and **SystemVerilog**. Lastly, being a hardcore **gamejammer** I am familiar with the **Unity** engine and other popular tools of the trade.

In my free time I am doing a ton of **bouldering**, chasing them good waves :wave: and powder days :skiing: and when I am finally so tired I can sit patiently in one place then I have time and energy for learning **hardware hacking** and some **reverse engineering** - preferably in the retro-computing space. I am also a dog-person, although right now because of my travels I do not have a doggo of my own.

I have graduated with an MSc in **Embedded Systems** at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**, Sweden and **University of Turku**, Finland as a part of EIT Digital Programme. Thesis titled: *"FPGA accelerated tcpdump using eBPF"* goes into the topic of hardware acceleration of packet capturing in embedded Linux system using an FPGA. It was a cooperative effort between KTH and [Tietoevry].

I have also graduated from **Warsaw University of Technology** with the thesis: *"FPGA based hardware accelerator for musical synthesis for Linux system"*.

You can see both below the *Story* section.

{{< image src="/about_res/EOSS_logo.png" alt="Embedded Open Source Summit 2023" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Me and **[Szymon Duchniewicz]** spoke at **Embedded Open Source Summit** on the topic of *[Porting an AI Powered Wearable Health Monitor to Zephyr on Open Hardware]*. You may refer to [the video] and [the blog post] for more details. In short we briefly explained the first iteration of our project on non-Zephyr OS (Arduino) and the presented the challenges and shortcomings of that approach. Then showed how we ported the solution to [QuickLogic EOS S3 platform] and ran it on **[Zephyr OS]**. We also commented on how we designed the entire system, including the **Machine Learning** model for Blood Pressure inference (whose breakdown you can see in [this blog post]). The entire presentation featured a plethora of tips regarding porting Zephyr to a new platform (as it turned out the EOS S3 had *really* basic Zephyr support.
**Skills:** `C`, `Zephyr`, `Machine Learning`, `Hardware acceleration`, `3D printing`

### State of Open Con
{{< image src="/about_res/sooc23.png" alt="State of Open Con 23" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

During this presentation, the topic of **hardware acceleration** using **FPGA**s in an **embedded Linux** was covered. Presented was a solution based on a custom **Linux** distribution assembled using the **Buildroot** tool, specially configured and patched **Linux** kernel, **uboot bootloader**, and the **programmable logic** for packet acceleration.

The project was evaluated on a **De0-Nano System on Chip development board** through modifications to burst lengths, packet sizes, and programmable logic clock frequency.
Metrics include packet capturing time, time per packet, and consumed power.
Finally, the results were contrasted with baseline **embedded Linux** packet processing by inspection of a packet‚Äôs path through the kernel.

After the presentation, a lengthy discussion arose and interesting future ideas for the project were imagined. It can be viewed [online here].

**Skills:** `C`, `FPGA`, `Linux`, `Networking`, `Hardware acceleration`

### The Deluge
{{< image src="/about_res/deluge.png" alt="The Deluge" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

My name is Jakub Duchniewicz and welcome to the **[Sticky Piston Studios]**!

I have been game jamming since 2016 and when in 2019 me and **[Mateusz Szymo≈Ñski]** have jammed for the first time - **[Eternal Feud]** (a game where you shoot at each other with bleating sheep) was born. Unfortunately in 2020 Covid struck and all on-site jams were canceled.

We came back to on-site jamming in 2022 and in force! After onboarding **[Szymon]** 1 jam earlier, **we were able to win the entire competition of HackYeah 2022!**

**[The Deluge]** was made in **only 24 hours** and is a combination of **FTL**-like map exploration, a deck builder and a real-time strategy battle fighting. We used **DALL-E** for generation of most of the graphics and made the rest on our own. Be sure to check it out on **itch.io**!

**Skills:** `Unity`, `Generative AI`, `C#`, `Game design`

### '21 GSoC beagleboard.org - GPGPU using OpenGL ES on BBBa
{{< image src="/about_res/beagle.png" alt="beagleboard.org" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

This project was part of the **Google Summer of Code** initiative under the **[beagleboard.org]** organization. With this library you can accelerate your computations using built-in **SGX GPU** onboard the **Beaglebone Black**.

Motivation for the project was scarcity of heteregenousity on the **BBB** platform which means that most computations were done either on the **CPU** or in the **PRU** or both of them. Meanwhile **GPU** on the **SoC** was laying mostly untouched apart from some rare occasions where rendering was required - **[this is unacceptable]** and [this project aims to change that]!

**Skills:** `C`, `OpenGL ES`, `Hardware acceleration`, `GPGPU`

## MSc Thesis:
### *"FPGA accelerated tcpdump using eBPF"*

[PDF for viewing.]

**Abstract**:
With the rise of the Internet of Things and the proliferation of embedded
devices equipped with an accelerator arose a need for eÔ¨Äicient resource
utilization. Hardware acceleration is a complex topic that requires specialized
domain knowledge about the platform and different trade-offs that have to be
made, especially in the area of power consumption. EÔ¨Äicient work offloading
strives to reduce or at least maintain the total power consumption of the
system. Offloading packet capturing is usually done in more powerful devices,
hence scarce research is present concerning network packet acceleration in
embedded devices.
The thesis focuses on accelerating networking packets utilizing a Field
Programmable Gate Array in an embedded Linux System. The solution is
based on a custom Linux distribution assembled using the Buildroot tool,
specially configured and patched Linux kernel, uboot bootloader, and the
programmable logic for packet acceleration. The system is evaluated on
a De0-Nano System on Chip development board through modifications to
burst lengths, packet sizes, and programmable logic clock frequency. Metrics
include packet capturing time, time per packet, and consumed power. Finally,
the results are contrasted with baseline embedded Linux packet processing by
inspection of a packet‚Äôs path through the kernel.
Collected results provide a deeper understanding of the packet acceleration
problem in embedded devices and the resultant system gives a solid starting
point for possible extensions such as packet filtering. Key findings include
an improvement in packet processing speed as the clock frequency and burst
length are increased while maintaining power consumption. Additionally,
the solution performs better when the packet sizes are above 64 bytes as the
overhead of additional logic necessary for their processing is compensated.
The project is also found to be significantly faster than regular in kernel
processing with the caveat of providing just packet capturing whereas Linux
contains a full network stack.

## BSc Thesis:
### *"FPGA based hardware accelerator for musical synthesis for Linux system"*

You can view the .pdf [here].

**Abstract**: Work focuses on realizing audio synthesizer in a System on Chip, utilizing FPGA
hardware resources. The resulting sound can be polyphonic and can be played directly
by an analog connection and is returned to the Hard Processor System running Linux
OS. It covers aspects of sound synthesis in hardware and writing Linux Device Drivers
for communicating with the FPGA utilizing DMA. An optimal approach to synthesis is
researched and assessed and LUT-based interpolation is asserted as the best choice for
this project. A novel State Variable IIR Filter is implemented in Verilog and utilized. Four
waveforms are synthesized: sine, square, sawtooth and triangle, and their switching can
be done instantaneously. A sample mixer capable of spreading the overflowing amplitudes
in phase is implemented. Linux Device Driver conforming to the ALSA standard is written
and utilized as a soundcard capable of generating the sound of 24 bits precision at 96kHz
sampling speed in real time. The system is extended with a simple GPIO analog sound
output through 1 pin Sigma-Delta DAC.

**Keywords**: FPGA, Sound Synthesis, SoC, DMA, SVF
