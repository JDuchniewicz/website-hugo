## Opening word

I always wanted to have my own personal place for sharing my both technical and geeky content with the general public. Well, here it is and I hope it will be of some use to you. 
In the upcoming days I am mostly doing my thesis project and cannot publish it until it is done and defended... However, I will post some other posts related to some side projects of my own and of course [PolyEngine].
