**TL;DR:**
--- 
**[Link to our talk]**
--- 
**[Link to Szymon's talk on Green Software for Embedded Devices]**
--- 

By the end of June, me and [Szymon] travelled to **Prague, Czech Republic** for the **[Embedded Open Source Summit 2023]** where we participated in the conference both as speakers and attendees. We also attended **[Xen Developer Summit]** and the **[Yocto Project Dev Day]**!

## Our talk

Our talk titled **"Porting an AI Powered Wearable Health Monitor to Zephyr on Open Hardware** boasted almost **full room** by which we were very flattered. Warm thanks to everyone who engaged with us after the talk and hope you took away something useful from this presentation.

In short, we presented a *war-story* where we worked on adding support for **[QuickLogic]'s [EOS S3] SoC** running the **[Zephyr] real-time operating system**, while deploying a Blood Pressure prediction model that you may already know from **[this post]**. The model was deployed using **[TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers]** which proved to be very easy and accurate.

Here you may see the breadboard prototype as we didn't have time to remake the original case [Szymon] envisioned for the previous iteration of this project.

## Beagleboard.org

The highlights from this conference include **finally meeting [Jason Kridner] - the founder of [beagleboard.org]** for whom we had the pleasure to create projects during **[Google Summer of Code 2021] where I did [GPGPU computing with BBB] and Szymon started porting [Zephyr] support for [Wio Terminal] to act as a [Greybus] host for [BeagleConnect Freedom]**. We also met other folks from the *beagleboard.org* organization including **[Kathy Giori]** and **[Drew Fustini]** who conducted a panel regarding future of *beagleboard.org* foundation.

**BTW - fresh RISC-V board dropped from beagleboard.org - [BeagleV Ahead] based on Alibaba T-Head chip!**

## Zephyr

We also met some **[Zephyr]** people who helped us a lot during development of this project - **[Chris Friedt]** or **[Henrik Brix Andersen]** as well as **[Benjamin Cabé]**. **Actually, there are already three PR's** that were the direct result of our participation in this conference and in this project **[1],[2], [3]**. Being an **Open Source contributor** to such an important project is surely satisfying :sunglasses:.

We plan to continue extending our support for **[Zephyr]** for this board by adding support for more peripherals and trying to decouple the Zephyr subsystem implementation from the **[Hardware Abstraction Layer]** from Quicklogic. Also, since I have always been eager to **[learn PCB design]** we might create a single PCB for this solution (**but that's a stretch and the day has only 24 hours, eh?**).

I now have a beautiful [Zephyr] kite :kite: (that I wish I could surf on :grin:) in my living/*hacking* room.

*Oh we also had the opportunity to see [Josef's Prusa] HQ in Holešovice Praha.*

## What's next?

Since we are only getting started, expect us on **further conferences around Autumn** (**[Hackaday Supercon]** and **[RISC-V Summit]** :wink: - *not yet confirmed*), and now we will enjoy some well deserved rest and vacation :smile: (Windsurfing :surfer: time for Szymon and some gym :weight_lifting: and cycling :bicyclist: for me). Enjoy the Summer folks!

Also, stay tuned for something from **[Sticky Piston Studios]** as even though we will be mostly resting, **something nice is en-route** :grin:
