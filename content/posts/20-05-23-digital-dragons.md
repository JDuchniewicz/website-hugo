This post starts a new trend of more lifestyle-oriented posts rather than fully-technical. \
A little bit more about my current status - **I am recovering from ACL reconstruction that I had mid-April so that's why you might see me with crutches in some of pictures posted below :smile:**.

## Why go there?

We received tickets to [Digital Dragons] during [HackYeah] 2022 on which we also won with our game [The Deluge] that you are encouraged to try and enjoy! Below you can see us in the moment of triumph:

## Who are we?

We are **[Sticky Piston Studios]** and we are a team of 3 passionate young people who have been working in the industry for a while already. **Having attended more than 15 gamejams in total we feel that it is time to transition to game publishing** so stay tuned for some of our new productions :grin:!

Below you may see the holy trinity: **COO, CEO and CTO in that order. [Szymon Duchniewicz] (Willmish), Me (Celeborth) and [Mateusz Szymoński] (Hist0r)**

## Quick update from Digital Dragons 2023

Digital dragons were filled to the brim with good laughs, *people on crutches*, talks about building a healthy company and how to best capitalize on the market during tough times. We attended different tracks and while I focused mostly on the teambuilding and mobile tracks, our CTO attended more technical talks and some post-mortems, such as House Flipper or Castle Crumble. Szymon, on the other hand, participated in talks about market development and brand construction. During the **Indie Expo** we met with several publishers with whom we plan our future releases and we also had pleasure to play innovative Indie games that were nominated to Indie Awards.

Lastly, here is a picture of us with our badges and the shiny Digital Dragons logo :grin:

Next stop, **[Embedded Open Source Summit 2023] in Prague** with my and Szymon's talk on **embedded health blood-pressure measuring device based on Zephyr OS and open hardware**. Until next time!
